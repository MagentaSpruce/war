<h3 className="text-center p-2 "> This is <strong>torture</strong>.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2 "> She is now currently in the appeal process. There is little reason to think justice will be served without your help however.</h3>


<h3 className="text-center p-2">Ashley used to be allowed to have phone calls with friends and family. Ashley used to be allowed up to ten books per month. She used to be allowed to be sent letters.</h3>




<h3 className="text-center p-2">However in the middle of the night on December 29th, 2021, guards came to her cell. They forcibly packed her up and sent her to another prison on the mainland despite her appeal being ongoing where she was then immediately put into another 28 day complete isolation.</h3>

<h3  className="text-center p-2">This is enraging.</h3>



<h3 className="text-center p-2">After this isolation ended the outside world was informed that Ashley would no longer be allowed any books. She would not be allowed letters. She would only be allowed two phone calls per YEAR, not to exceed ten minutes each.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">How is this possible? Even Edward Snowden is allowed correspondence. Who did Ashley kill to be treated thus?</h3>
