<h3 className="text-center p-2 md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto">Ashley used to be allowed to have phone calls with friends and family. Ashley used to be allowed up to ten books per month. She used to be allowed to be sent letters.</h3>




<h3 className="text-center p-2 md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto">However in the middle of the night on December 29th, 2021, guards came to her cell. They forcibly packed her up and sent her to another prison on the mainland despite her appeal being ongoing where she was then immediately put into another 28 day complete isolation.</h3>
