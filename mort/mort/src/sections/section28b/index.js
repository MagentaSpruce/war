          Tristan is no monster. In fact, nearer to the opposite is true.
          Tristan and Ashley lived a life of peace and happiness together for
          years. He loved Ashley. He loves her still. He gave her everything - a
          dream life which included his whole heart. The first and only time
          another human had ever received it so fully.

        <h3 className="text-center p-2 md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto">
          Tristan would never have given up and risked so much if it were
          otherwise. He knew she was "guilty," the entire time but loyalty
          trumps reputation. Once she was free he knew the truth would come out
          anyway but unfortunately the self-sacrifice has not freed Ashley. She
          remains languishing behind bars for a victimless crime with no end in
          sight.{' '}
          <b>
            Thus it no longer serves any useful purpose to continue playing the
            monster.

          Tristan Nettles has given up everything for his love. It will be much
          easier to unite the world behind him with the truth made public. He
          desires only the freedom of Miss Ashley Oosthuizen. He has been
          fighting for over 3.5 years non-stop spanning all across the globe but
          he has gone about as far as one man without great means can go.
