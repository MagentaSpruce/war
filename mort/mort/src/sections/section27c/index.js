          Upon Ashley's arrest Tristan resigned from his dream of medical
          school. Then the story that he and Ashley had prepared before leaving
          Koh Samui for just such an emergency was made public; that he, Sergei,
          and another man named Dave Rensburg whom the package had been
          addressed to were the ones wholly responsible. Tristan stated publicly
          that Ashley had nothing to do with it and that he sent the packages
          without her knowledge or consent.{' '}

            <span className="text-indigo-400">But this is not true.</span>

          The story Ashley and Tristan prepared and used would have still worked
          if all Ashley had done was sign her name to the package.
          Unfortunately, the other evidence the police collected made this route
          impossible. Nevertheless, Tristan continued to maintain Ashley's
          complete innocence whilst spending $35,000 USD on her trial defense,
          the result of which resulted in a life sentence anyway.
