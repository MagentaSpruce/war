<h3 className="text-center p-2">Ashley's lawyer Noppadol from Thailand Bail was paid over $35,000 and did not even argue in her defense. This poor young woman has been let down by the system and its benefactors at every turn.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">Where young girls are made to pay the ultimate price for crimes which men decades older than them committed? </h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">Where being hounded into signing a package by a man sent by police to force the issue is equated to a drug importation charge with a death sentence commuted to life in prison despite NO other proof?</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">I beg you get outraged. She is a poor, defensless, and completely alone young woman who has never hurt anyone and who has no one to fight for her. She needs you desperately. Please fight for her.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">If admitted rapist and murderers deserve bail and freedom, why doesn't Ashley?</h3>
