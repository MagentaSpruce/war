          Once Tristan finished building the websites and writing the novel
          which made Ashley known to the world back in February 2022, he then
          continued to go to war for Ashley. Literally.
        </h3>

        <h3 className="text-center p-2 md:w-[90%] md:mx-auto">
          At that time Tristan left everything behind and went to volunteer with
          the Ukrainian Foreign Legion in their newly started fight against the
          Russians. The reason that Tristan went to war for his beloved was
          because he believed that by helping to fight for other people's
          freedom, other people would help fight for Ashley's.
        </h3>

        <h3 className="text-center p-2 md:w-[90%] md:mx-auto">
          Tristan continued to send letters, love, and funds to Ashley while he
          fought in Ukraine. Everyday new attempts were made to get her story
          reported to the outside world. From the 12 men Tristan started with
          only 3 remained by their fifth month in country.

          Tristan gave up his dream, ruined his reputation, taught himself to
          code, built websites, wrote novels that became published and then
          charged the battlefields of Ukraine while screaming{' '}
          <b>Free Ashley!</b> as his war cry.{' '}
