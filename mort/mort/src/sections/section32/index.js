<h3 className="text-center p-2">Please, make this your fight. Ashley needs your help now more than ever. She is only 22 years old. Right now as you read these words she languishes in a Thai prison cell where she does not even understand the words spoken for a crime she had nothing to do with. She has not been heard from by anyone for over two months. She is not allowed books, letters, or calls.</h3>


<h1 className="text-center p-2">Won't you please help Ashley Oosthuizen? </h1>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">Please, at least share this website and her story and if you are able to do more, she would be most grateful if you did. Be well assured that she is certainly worth it. Thank you for your help, compassion, and time.</h3>
