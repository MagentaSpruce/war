          novel dedicated to Ashley. 100% of the author profits from her novel
          will go directly to Ashley's donation fund, Hearts4Ashley, which is
          under the direct control of Ashley's mother, Lynn Blignaut, to be used

          The purpose of this novel, which will be published March 12, 2024, is
          to raise enough resources and publicity for Ashley Oosthuizen to
          finally get her voice heard on the world stage. This will then allow
          for alternate outcomes than her current ongoing life sentence to be
          arranged.
