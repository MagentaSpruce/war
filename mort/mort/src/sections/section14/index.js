          After the MDMA was discovered{' '}
          <span className="text-red-500">Liam Capone</span> called the Bophut
          Police Department on Koh Samui to accuse Tristan of drug importing. He
          knew that Tristan was already out of the country and that Ashley
          Oosthuizen was both his girlfriend and the manager of his biscuit
          shop.

          <span className="text-red-500">Liam Capone</span> then with the help
          of Panyadee International School's owner, a Thai mafioso named Mr. Big
          who owns many hotels on the island, conspired to have the local police
          department set up a sting on Tristan's business.{' '}

          By setting up Ashley Oosthuizen to take the fall, Liam, who despised
          Tristan, would thus be able to injure him. And so it was out of spite

          <span className="text-red-500"> Liam Capone</span> carried through
          with his plan.

          But it was only a job half done since Tristan remained{' '}
