<h3 className="text-center p-2">The South African embassy, from the country that saw Nelson Mandela freed from his unjust incarceration, have done absolutely nothing in the face of this growing scandal.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">They have been informed every step of the way with provided evidence which they too have repeatedly sought to ignore. They have been willingly complicit in the travesty of justice which continues to be perpetrated against this young woman daily by the Thai authorities.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">B Mokoena, Third Secretary Admin, Mr. Mabena, Director and Ms. R. Chaiyasol, Receptionist, all of these Bangkok South African Embassy officials  have given no support to Ashley and should be held accountable for their complicity in this series of outrages which are still being further committed.</h3></div>
