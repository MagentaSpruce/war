<h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto">It looks very ill for the school and for the police department to have an international drug operation being run successfully right under their noses by school teachers for years.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica lg:text-lg md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto"> It looks much better to have the drugs coming from somewhere else. Tristan used Hot in the Biscuit for less than 6 weeks to import drugs. He used Panyadee for well more than a hundred. So why is Ashley the one in chains?</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica lg:text-lg md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto">Why wasn't Panyadee charged with importation? Did they not accept packages of drugs and then later also open them as well? Ashley never tampered with the package at all. So one parties ignorance is lawful and the other parties ignorance is not? Where is the reason?</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto">Ashley in the meantime, a 21 year old girl and former kindergarten teacher with no prior criminal record, was sentenced to death. Mercifully commuted to life in prison. At 21 years old. For being pressured into signing her name on a package by a delivery man ordered to get a signature by the police.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica">This is justice? No, that is entrapment.</h3>
