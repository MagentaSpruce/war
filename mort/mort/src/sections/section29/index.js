Ashley only needs one influencer, one celebrity, or government official willing to help take her cause to the world so that this travesty of justice can be undone.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2">Please email MokoenaB@dirco.gov.za , MabenaS@dirco.gov.za, or ChaiyasolR@dirco.gov.za at the South African Embassy in Bangkok to file an official complaint against them for their utter lack of interest, service, or appreciable action. They have failed Ashley at every turn and deserve to be replaced.</h3>

 <h3 className="text-center p-2">Send an email to the South African Embassy itself in protest of the current madness transpiring. You can email them here: <span className="underline underline-offset-4 cursor-pointer">bangkok.consular@dirco.gov.za</span></h3>
