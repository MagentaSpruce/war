          Tristan Nettles is going to utilize the websites, social media, books,
          and everything else done thus far in order to create a following that
          becomes large enough to provide both the resources and publicity to
          force the Thai side to the negotiating table. The objectives are to
          create as large a base of support and resources as possible for Ashley
          while simultaneously eroding Thailand's support on the world stage and
          in so doing affect their tourist based economy in a negative manner.
        </h3>
        <h3 className="text-center p-2 md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto">
          Brittney Griner has shown us what is possible and Thailand cares and
          depends much more on its global image than Russia does. Please tweet
          <span className="text-green-400"> @elonmusk</span> and ask him to
          publicize her nightmare as well. Ashley only needs one influencer, one
          celebrity, or government official willing to help take up her cause to
          the world so that this travesty of justice can be undone.
