<h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica">After Ashley was laid off she tried working many odd jobs around the island as a nanny, tutor, and even as an aerial yoga instructor.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica">However none of these positions afforded Ashley a work permit and without a work permit she would eventually have to return back to South Africa.</h3>

<h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica">It was at this time that Tristan offered Ashley the opportunity to work as the manager for a new restaraunt that he wanted to open. That way she would have a valid work permit and be able to continue living on the island.</h3>
