          After more than 2,000 emails sent in country whilst fighting a war on
          two fronts, Tristan finally got a major news outlet to agree to run a
          story on Ashley.{' '}

        <h3 className="text-center p-2 font-economica md:w-[80%] md:mx-auto">
          After a particularly violent mission in which multiple men were lost,
          including an American, the reporter named Seth Harp from Rollingstone
          magazine finally became interested in Tristan's repeated messages.

          Tristan sent Seth Harp everything about Ashley. Yet when the piece was
          finished, Ashley had barely been mentioned at all. The entire focus
          was on the second American to be KIA in Ukraine instead. Seth Harp and
          Rollingstone couldn't give a damn about Ashley. She was the wrong
          nationality. He said:{' '}

          People do care. The strategy was flawed however because it's the media
          gate keepers who don't. Without the media, know one heard what was
          going on. Everything remained on Tristan alone.{' '}
